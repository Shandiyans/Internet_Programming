            <h1>Opportunities</h1>
            <p>Computer science and Engineering graduates are the pillars of the current and emerging information
                era. Opportunities include pursuing Master of Science Programs in reputed Universities of U.S. and
                taking up research assignments in Hardware, System Software, Computer Engineering, Multimedia,
                Networking and Communication areas.<br><br>
                
                Job opportunities are ever increasing and are varied in nature. System study. analysis, Design and
                Programming are the inherent phases in Application Development and each one of them provides
                enormous potential to the Computer Science and engineering graduates to shape themselves in their
                career. Hi-end profiles include Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Graphic Solutions and Simulations.<br><br>
                
                This degree program prepares students for Advanced, Technical Computer Systems Design and
                Development Work. It includes the study of the Database Design, Data Communications,
                Procedural and Object Oriented Programming, Operating Systems Design. Algorithm Development
                and Applications of Artificial Intelligence. The curriculum includes basic course work in
                Electronics Technology and the Theory of Programming Languages. Students focus on developing
                computer-based solutions involving hardware and software components and tegration. Graduates
                are qualified to work in a range of positions, from entry-level computer scientists and system
                engineers to project managers leading advanced applications of computer science to real-world
                problems. The department has since broadened its research strengths
